# offsetX Project Rules

## CRITICAL: Always Read Documentation First

Before responding to ANY query or making ANY changes, you MUST read these files in order:

1. **KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md** - Essential project context, flows, bugs, fixes, and implementation details
2. **non-negotiables.md** - Development rules and constraints
3. **plan.md** - Project plan with objectives, roles, flows, and architecture
4. **progress.md** - Current status and what's been completed
5. **implementation.md** - Implementation guide (if working on specific steps)

## Project Context

This is a UK nitrate/phosphate offset exchange platform (offsetX) with:
- Smart contracts (Hardhat + Solidity)
- Backend (FastAPI + SQLite)
- Frontend (React + TypeScript)

## Key Rules

- Always update KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md when discovering bugs, fixing issues, or learning new flows
- **MUST update progress.md after completing any work** (see Rule 8 in non-negotiables.md)
- **MUST keep all documentation files synchronized** with code changes
- Follow the rules in non-negotiables.md strictly
- One step at a time - never skip ahead
- Test before requesting approval
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

## Documentation Maintenance

**After ANY work session, update these files in order:**

1. **progress.md** - ALWAYS (current status, problems, solutions, change log)
2. **KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md** - If bugs/flows/details discovered (update "Last Updated" date)
3. **plan.md** - Only if architecture/specs changed significantly
4. **implementation.md** - Only if steps completed/modified
5. **README.md** - Only if setup/status changed

**Reference Documentation (update as needed):**
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Add new common issues
- `QUICK_START.md` - Update if setup process changes
- `RESTART_GUIDE.md` - Update if restart process changes

**Historical Documentation (archive, don't update):**
- `WHAT_HAPPENED.md`, `QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md`, etc. - These are snapshots, not living docs

## When Starting a New Chat Session

1. Read KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md FIRST to understand:
   - Project structure and architecture
   - Key flows and how they work
   - Known bugs and their fixes
   - Important implementation details
   - Common issues and solutions

2. Then read other documentation as needed

This ensures continuity across chat sessions and prevents rediscovering known issues.
